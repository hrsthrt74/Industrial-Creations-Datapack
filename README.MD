# Industrial Creations Datapack

Industrial Creations Datapack (or ICDP For short) is a Minecraft datapack to enhance the recipe compatibility between Create mod and Industrial Craft 2 mod.

## Usage
This datapack hasn't been finished yet. When it's ready, a release will be uploaded. Thank you for your patience!

## FAQ
- Fabric? Forge?

  Both. This datapack will try to be compatible as possible for both Fabric and Forge.
  
- I want XXX feature!

  Please say about it at the [issues page](https://github.com/hrsthrt74/Industrial-Creations-Datapack/issues).

- Support for IC2 Classic?

  This datapack is designed for IC2(Exp) and it doesn't support IC2 Classic.

  Also, there's no plan to make a classic-compatible one.
  
  Since this datapack is under the MIT license, you can make a fork of this repo to make a classic-compatible one.
